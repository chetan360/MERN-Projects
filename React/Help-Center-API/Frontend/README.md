###Under Developement!

**Project Remaining Requirements:**

1. **Set up the project:**

   - Create a new Node.js project using Express.js.
   - Set up a basic server with a single endpoint to check if the server is running (e.g., `GET /ping`).

2. **Create a Card Model:**

   - Model for a card. Each card has the following fields:
     - `id` (string): A unique identifier for the card.
     - `title` (string): The title of the card (e.g., "Branches").
     - `description` (string): A brief description of what the card represents (e.g., "Abstract Branches lets you manage, version, and document your designs in one place.").

3. **Build the API Endpoints:**

   - **Create a card:** Endpoint to add a new card to the help center.
     - `POST /cards`: This should accept the card details (title, description, link) in the request body and create a new card.
   - **Get all cards:** Endpoint to retrieve all the cards.
     - `GET /cards`: Returns a list of all cards in the help center.
   - **Get a specific card:** Endpoint to retrieve the details of a single card by its title.
     - `GET /cards/:title`: Returns the details of a specific card.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Error handling for cases such as trying to access a non-existent card, validation errors, and server errors.
